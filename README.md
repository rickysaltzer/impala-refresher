Impala Table Metadata Refresher
===============================

Used for refreshing the metadata on a table across all of the nodes in a cluster. Metadata refreshing
will occurr concurrently, any node which exceeds a 1 minute refresh will timeout. 

This was designed because I needed a way to manually invoke a full retrieve of all the parititions on a given table for
every node in the cluster.

How To Use
----------

An error will be displayed if your node timesout or fails to refresh (non 0 exit code). If any of your nodes fail
to refresh, the exit code of impala-refresher will be 1. 

Usage:

    Usage of ./impala-refresher:
      -concurrency=0: Max number of refreshes to perform concurrently (0: unlimited)
      -nodes="":    Comma separated list of impala daemons to refresh
      -table="":    Table to refresh
      -timeout=60:  Refresh timeout in seconds

Example:

    $ ./impala-refresher --table mytable --nodes node-01,node-02,node-03,node-04,node-05,node-06
    Refreshing node-01's metadata...
    Refreshing node-02's metadata...
    Refreshing node-03's metadata...
    Refreshing node-04's metadata...
    Refreshing node-05's metadata...
    Refreshing node-06's metadata...
    node-06 refreshed successfully! Took: 25.195226472s
    node-05 refreshed successfully! Took: 26.145260728s
    node-04 refreshed successfully! Took: 26.268907552s
    node-03 refreshed successfully! Took: 26.753072643s
    node-01 refreshed successfully! Took: 27.024496418s
    node-02 refreshed successfully! Took: 27.654374677s

With concurrency set to *3*

    $ ./impala-refresher --table mytable --nodes node-01,node-02,node-03,node-04,node-05,node-06 --concurrency 3
    Refreshing node-01's metadata...
    Refreshing node-02's metadata...
    Refreshing node-03's metadata...
    node-02 refreshed successfully! Took: 19.313201ms
    node-01 refreshed successfully! Took: 19.564682ms
    node-03 refreshed successfully! Took: 20.187352ms
    Refreshing node-04's metadata...
    Refreshing node-05's metadata...
    Refreshing node-06's metadata...
    node-04 refreshed successfully! Took: 22.933899ms
    node-05 refreshed successfully! Took: 40.255635ms
    node-06 refreshed successfully! Took: 45.224793ms



How To Build
------------

The only requirement is [go](http://golang.org/), The build time is basically instant. If you compile on Linux, you can
distribute the binary to other Linux machines. It doesn't require any special libraries on the host as far as I know. I've tested on systems as old as CentOS 5.6.

Building:

    $ git clone git://github.com/rickysaltzer/impala-refresher.git
    $ cd impala-refresher
    $ go build
    $ ls
    impala-refresher.go impala-refresher
